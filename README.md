## 💥⭕How to contribute?
### 1. 👇🏻Star and Fork this Repository
###### You can star ⭐ and fork 🍽️ this repository on GitHub by navigating at the top of this repository.


###### GitHub repository URLs will reference both the username associated with the owner of the repository, as well as the repository name.


###### When you’re on the main page for the repository, you’ll see a button to "Star" and “Fork” the repository on your upper right-hand side of the page, underneath your user icon.

### 2. 👇🏻Clone the Repository

###### To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let’s first open up a terminal window.

###### We’ll use the `git clone`  command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository.

### 3. 👇🏻Update Local Repository

###### While working on a project alongside other contributors, it is important for you to keep your local repository up-to-date with the project as you don’t want to make a pull request for code that will cause conflicts. To keep your local copy of the code base updated, you’ll need to sync changes.

###### We’ll first go over configuring a remote for the fork, then syncing the fork.

### 4. 👇🏻Sync the Fork

###### Once you have configured a remote that references the upstream and original repository on GitHub, you are ready to sync your fork of the repository to keep it up-to-date.
###### To sync your fork, from the directory of your local repository in a terminal window, you’ll have to use the // git fetch // command to fetch the branches along with their respective commits from the upstream repository. Since you used the shortname “upstream” to refer to the upstream repository, you’ll have to pass that to the command:

##### ` git fetch upstream `

###### Switch to the local master branch of our repository:

##### ` git checkout master `

###### Now merge any changes that were made in the original repository’s master branch, that you will access through your local upstream/master branch, with your local master branch:

##### ` git merge upstream/master `

### 5. 👇🏻Create Pull Request

###### At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.

###### Now navigate to your forked repository, and press the “New pull request” button on your left-hand side of the page.
